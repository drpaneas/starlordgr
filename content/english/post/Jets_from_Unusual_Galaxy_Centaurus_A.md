The jets emanating fromCentaurus A are over a million light years long.These jets of streamingplasma,expelled by a giant black hole in the center of this spiral galaxy,  light up this composite image ofCen A.Exactly how thecentral black holeexpels infalling matter remains unknown.After clearing the galaxy, however,the jets inflate largeradio bubbles that likely glow for millions of years.If energized by a passing gas cloud, the radio bubbles can even light up again after billions of years.X-ray light is depicted in thefeatured composite image in blue, whilemicrowave light is colored orange.  The base of the jet in radio light showsdetails of the innermost light year of thecentral jet.
