Near the heart of theVirgo Galaxy Clusterthe string of galaxies known as Markarian'sChain stretches across this deeptelescopic field of view.Anchored in the frame at bottom center by prominent lenticular galaxies,M84 (bottom)and M86,you can follow the chain up and to the right.Near center you'll spot the pair of interacting galaxiesNGC 4438 and NGC 4435, known to some asMarkarian's Eyes.Its center an estimated 50 million light-years distant,the Virgo Cluster itself is the nearestgalaxy cluster.With up to about 2,000 member galaxies, it has anoticeable gravitational influence on our ownLocal Group of Galaxies.Within the Virgo Cluster at least seven galaxies in Markarian's Chain   appear to movecoherently,although others may appear to be part of the chain by chance.
