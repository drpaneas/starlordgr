Point your telescope toward the high flying constellationPegasusand you can find thisexpanseof Milky Way stars and distant galaxies.NGC 7814 is centered in the prettyfield of view that would almostbe covered by a full moon.NGC 7814 issometimes called the Little Sombrero for itsresemblance to the brighter more famous M104,the Sombrero Galaxy.Both Sombrero and Little Sombrero are spiral galaxiesseen edge-on, and both have extensive halos and centralbulges cut by a thin disk with thinner dust lanes in silhouette.In fact, NGC 7814is some 40 million light-years away and an estimated 60,000 light-yearsacross.That actually makes theLittle Sombreroabout the same physical size asits better known namesake, appearing smaller and fainteronly because it is farther away.In this telescopic view from July 17, NGC 7814 is hosting a newlydiscovered supernova, dominant immediately to the left of the galaxy's core.Cataloged as SN 2021rhu,the stellar explosion has been identified as aType Iasupernova, useful toward calibrating thedistance scaleofthe universe.
