Plowing throughEarth's atmosphere at 60 kilometers per second,this bright perseid meteor streaks along a starry Milky Way.Captured in dark Portugal skies on August 12, it movesright to left through the frame.Its colorful trail starts near Deneb (alpha Cygni)and ends near Altair (alpha Aquilae),stars of the northernsummer triangle.In fact this perseid meteorvery briefly outshines both,two of the brightest stars in planet Earth's night.The trail's initial greenish glow is typical of the brightperseid shower meteors.The grains of cosmic sand,swept updust from periodic comet Swift-Tuttle,are moving fast enough to excitethe characteristic green emission of atomic oxygenat altitudes of 100 kilometersor so before vaporizing in an incandescent flash.
