Surprisingly reminiscent of The Great Nebula in Orion,The Great Turkey Nebula spans this creative field of view. Of courseif it were the Orion Nebula it would be our closestlarge stellar nursery, found at the edge of a large molecular clouda mere 1,500 light-years away.Also known as M42,the Orion Nebula is visible to the eye as the middle"star" in the sword of Orion the Hunter, a constellationnow rising in planet Earth'sevening skies.Stellar winds from clusters of newborn stars scattered throughoutthe Orion Nebula sculpt its ridges and cavities seen infamiliar in telescopic images.Similar in size to the Orion Nebula, this Great Turkey Nebulawas imagined to be about 13 light-years across.Stay safe and well.
