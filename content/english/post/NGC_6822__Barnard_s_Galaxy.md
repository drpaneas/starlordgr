Grand spiral galaxiesoften seem to get all the glory, flaunting theiryoung, bright, blue star clusters in beautiful, symmetric spiral arms.But small galaxies form stars too, like nearby NGC 6822, also known asBarnard'sGalaxy.Beyond the rich starfields in the constellation Sagittarius,NGC 6822 is a mere 1.5 million light-years away, a member of ourLocal Groupof galaxies.A dwarf irregular galaxy similar to theSmall Magellanic Cloud,NGC 6822 is about 7,000 light-years across.Brighter foreground stars in our Milky Way have a spiky appearance.Behind them,Barnard's Galaxy is seen to be filled with young blue stars and mottled withthe telltale pinkish hydrogen glowof star forming regions in this deepcolor composite image.
