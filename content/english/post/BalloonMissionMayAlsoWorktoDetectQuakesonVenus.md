An opportunity in 2019 lays the groundwork for balloon-borne detectors on Venus, working to unravel a key mystery. The skies of Venus may become a busy place in the coming decade, using technology field-tested here on Earth. A team out of NASA JPL-Caltech hypothesized that terrestrial earthquakes should also produce low-frequency infrasonic sound waves, which would be transmitted from the ground through the atmosphere as changes in barometric pressure. These sound waves, while difficult to detect, should be measurable via highly sensitive barometers carried aloft. Continue reading “Balloon Mission May Also Work to Detect Quakes on Venus”
