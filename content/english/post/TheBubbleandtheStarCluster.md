To the eye,this cosmic compositionnicely balances theBubble Nebula at the right with open star cluster M52.The pair would be lopsided on other scales, though.Embedded in a complex ofinterstellar dustand gas and blown by the winds from a single, massiveO-type star,the Bubble Nebula, also known as NGC 7635, is amere 10 light-years wide.  On the other hand,M52 is a rich opencluster of around a thousand stars.The cluster is about 25 light-years across.Seen toward the northern boundaryof Cassiopeia, distance estimatesfor the Bubble Nebula and associated cloud complex are around11,000 light-years, whilestar cluster M52lies nearly 5,000 light-years away.The wide telescopic field of view spans about 1.5 degrees on the skyor three times the apparent size of a full Moon.
