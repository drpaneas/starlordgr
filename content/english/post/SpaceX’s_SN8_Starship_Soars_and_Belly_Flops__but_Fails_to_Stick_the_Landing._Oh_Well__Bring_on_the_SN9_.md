At long last, SpaceX has conducted the first high-altitude test flight with its prototype Starship vehicle! During the launch, the eighth iteration of their spacecraft (SN8) flew to an altitude of 12.5 km (~7.8 mi; 41,000 ft) and conducted some fancy maneuvers before returning to its landing pad. Unfortunately, the landing was a bit hot and the SN8 exploded as soon as it touched down.  Despite failing to make it home in one piece (well, technicality it did, but then exploded), SpaceX validated its Starship design for high-altitude flight, which is a major stepping stone to making regular spaceflights. What’s more, the data they gathered from this test and the failed landing is already being used to prepare for the next high-altitude flight test. So really, this test was a very important milestone on the road to conducting regular flights to the Moon and Mars.
