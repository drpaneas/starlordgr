Where did all the stars go?  What used to be considered a hole in the skyis now known to astronomers as a dark molecular cloud.  Here, a high concentration ofdust andmolecular gasabsorb practically all the visible lightemitted from background stars.  The eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors ofmolecular clouds some of the coldestand most isolated places in the universe.  One of the most notable of thesedark absorption nebulaeis a cloud toward the constellationOphiuchus known asBarnard 68,pictured here.  That no stars are visible in the center indicates thatBarnard68 is relatively nearby, with measurements placing it about500 light-years away and half a light-year across.  It is not known exactly howmolecular clouds likeBarnard 68 form, but it is known that these clouds are themselveslikely placesfor new stars to form.In fact, Barnard 68 itself hasbeen found likely to collapse and form a new star system.It is possible tolook right through the cloud in infrared light.
