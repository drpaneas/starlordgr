This shadowy landscapeof majestic mountains and icy plainsstretches toward the horizon on a small, distant world.It was captured from a range of about 18,000 kilometers whenNew Horizonslooked back toward Pluto,15 minutes after the spacecraft's closest approach on July 14.The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilightscene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montesfrom foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon,giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum atright.Layers of Pluto's tenuous atmosphere are also revealedin the backlit view.With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likelyincludes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide withwater-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet).That's comparable in height to themajestic mountains of planet Earth.The Plutonian landscape is 380 kilometers (230 miles) across.
