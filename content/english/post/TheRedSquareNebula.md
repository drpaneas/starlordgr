How did a round star create this square nebula?No one is quite sure.The round star, known as MWC 922 and possibly part of a multiple star system, appears at the center of the Red Square Nebula. The featured image combinesinfrared exposures from theHale Telescope onMt. Palomar inCalifornia, and theKeck-2 Telescope onMauna Kea inHawaii.  A leading progenitor hypothesis for thesquare nebula is that the central star or stars somehow expelled cones of gas during a latedevelopmental stage.For MWC 922,these cones happen to incorporate nearlyright anglesand be visible from the sides.  Supporting evidence for theconehypothesis includes radial spokes in the image that might run along thecone walls.Researchers speculate that the cones viewed fromanother angle would appear similar to the gigantic rings ofsupernova 1987A,possibly indicating that a star in MWC 922 might one day itself explode in a similarsupernova.
