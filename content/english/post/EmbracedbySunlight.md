Even though Venus(left) was the brightest planet in the sky it was less than1/30th the apparent size of the Moon on January 29.But as both rose before the Sun they shared a crescent phase.For a moment their visible disks were each about 12 percent illuminatedas they stood above the southeastern horizon.The similar sunlit crescents were captured inthese two separate images.Made at different magnifications, each panel is a composite ofstacked video frames taken with a small telescope.Venus goes through a range ofphases likethe Moon as the inner planetwanders from evening sky to morning skyand back again with a period of 584 days.Of course the Mooncompletes its own cycle of phases, a full lunation, in about29.5 days.
