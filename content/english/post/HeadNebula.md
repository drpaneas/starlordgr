Blown by fast winds from a hot, massive star,this cosmic bubble is huge.Cataloged asSharpless2-308 it lies some 5,000 light-years away toward the constellation ofthe Big Dog(CanisMajor) and covers slightly more of the sky than a Full Moon.Thatcorrespondsto a diameter of 60 light-years at its estimated distance.The massive star that created the bubble, aWolf-Rayet star,is the bright onenear the centerof the nebula.Wolf-Rayet stars have over 20 times the mass of the Sunand are thought to be in a brief,pre-supernova phaseof massive star evolution.Fast winds from this Wolf-Rayet starcreate the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution.The windblown nebula has an age of about 70,000years.Relatively faint emission captured by narrowband filters in the deep imageis dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atomsmapped toa blue hue.Presenting amostly harmlessoutline, SH2-308 is also known as The Dolphin-head Nebula.
