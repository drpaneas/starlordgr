Clouds of stardust drift through this deep skyscape,across thePerseus molecular cloudsome 850 light-years away.Dusty nebulae reflecting light from embedded young starsstand out in the nearly 2 degree wide telescopic field of view.With a characteristic bluish colorreflection nebula NGC 1333 is atcenter,vdB 13 at top right,with rare yellowish reflection nebulavdB 12 near the top of the frame.Stars are formingin the molecular cloud, though mostare obscured at visible wavelengths by the pervasive dust.Still, hints of contrasting red emission from Herbig-Haro objects,the jets and shocked glowing gas emanating from recently formed stars,are evidentin NGC 1333.The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sunformed over 4.5 billion years ago.At the estimated distance of the Perseus molecular cloud,this cosmic scene would span about 40 light-years.
