Whatever hit Mimas nearly destroyed it.  What remains is one of thelargest impact craters on one ofSaturn's smallest round moons.  Analysis indicates that a slightly larger impact would have destroyed Mimas entirely. The huge crater, namedHerschel after the 1789 discoverer of Mimas,Sir William Herschel, spans about 130 kilometers and isfeatured here.Mimas'low mass produces asurface gravity just strong enough to create aspherical body but weak enough to allowsuch relatively large surface features.Mimas is madeof mostly water ice with a smattering of rock - so it isaccurately described as a big dirty snowball.The featured image was taken during the closest-ever flyby of therobot spacecraft Cassini past Mimas in 2010 while in orbit around Saturn.
