Chaotic in appearance,these tangled filaments of shocked, glowing gas are spread acrossplanet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus as part of theVeil Nebula.The Veil Nebula itself is a largesupernova remnant, an expandingcloud born of the death explosion of a massive star.Light from the original supernova explosion likely reachedEarth over 5,000 years ago.The glowing filaments are really more like long ripples in a sheet seenalmost edge on, remarkably well separated intothe glow of ionized hydrogen atoms shown in blue and oxygen in red hues.Also known as the Cygnus Loop and cataloged as NGC 6979, theVeil Nebula now spans about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon.The length of the wisp corresponds to about 30 light years, given its estimated distance of 2,400 light years. Often identified as Pickering's Trianglefor a director of Harvard College Observatory, it is also named for its discoverer,astronomer Williamina Fleming, asFleming'sTriangular Wisp.
