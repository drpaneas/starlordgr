Could you survive a jump off the tallest cliff in the Solar System?Quite possibly.  Verona Rupes onUranus' moonMirandais estimated to be 20 kilometers deep -- ten times the depth of theEarth's Grand Canyon.   GivenMiranda's low gravity, it would take about 12 minutes for a thrill-seeking adventurer to fall from the top, reaching the bottom at the speed of aracecar -- about 200 kilometers per hour.   Even so, the fall might be survivable given properairbag protection.  The featured imageof Verona Rupes was captured by the passingVoyager 2 robotic spacecraft in 1986.  How the giant cliffwas created remains unknown, but is possibly related to alarge impact ortectonic surface motion.
