Gorgeous spiral galaxy M33 seems to have more than its fair share ofglowing hydrogen gas.A prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is alsoknown as the Triangulum Galaxy andlies a mere 3 million light-years away. Sprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core,M33's giantHII regions aresome of the largest known stellar nurseries,sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars.Intense ultraviolet radiationfrom the luminous massive stars ionizesthe surrounding hydrogen gas andultimately produces the characteristic red glow.To highlight the HII regions in this telescopic image,broadband data used to produce a color viewof the galaxy were combined with narrowband data recorded through ahydrogen-alpha filter,transmitting the light of the strongesthydrogen emission line.Close-ups of cataloged HII regions appear in the sidebar insets.Use the individual reference number tofind their location within the Triangulum Galaxy.For example, giantHII region NGC604is identified in an inset on the right and appears at position number 15.That's about 4 o'clock from galaxy center inthis portrait of M33.
