The sky is filled with faintly glowing gas, though it can take asensitive camera and telescope to see it.For example, this twelve-degree-wide view of thenorthern part of the constellationCygnusreveals a complex array of cosmic clouds of gasalong the plane of our Milky Way galaxy.The featured mosaic of telescopic images was recorded through two filters: an H-alpha filter that transmits only visible red light fromglowing hydrogen atoms,and a blue filter that transmits primarily light emitted by the slightamount of energized oxygen.Therefore, in this 18-hour exposure image, blue areas are hotter than red. Further digital processing has removed the myriad of point-like Milky Way stars from the scene.Recognizable bright nebulas includeNGC 7000 (North America Nebula), andIC 5070 (Pelican Nebula) on the left withIC 1318 (Butterfly Nebula) andNGC 6888 (Crescent Nebula) on the right --but others can be found throughout the wide field.
