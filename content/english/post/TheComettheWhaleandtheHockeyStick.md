Closest to the Sun on March 1, andclosest to planet Earth on April 23, thisComet ATLAS (C/2020 R4)shows a faint greenish coma and short tailin this pretty, telescopic field of view.Captured at its position on May 5,the comet was within the boundaries of northern constellation Canes Venatici(the Hunting Dogs),and near the line-of-sight to intriguing background galaxies popularlyknown as theWhale and the Hockey Stick.Cetacean in appearance but Milky Way sized, NGC 4631 is a spiral galaxy seenedge-on at the top right, some 25 million light-years away.NGC 4656/7 sports the bent-stick shape ofinteracting galaxiesbelow and left of NGC 4631.In fact, the distortions and mingling trails of gas detected at otherwavelengths suggest the cosmic Whale and Hockey Stick have hadclose encounters with each other in their distant past.Outbound andonly about 7 light-minutes from Earth this Comet ATLAS shouldrevisit the inner solar systemin just under 1,000 years.
