Point your telescopeat tonight's first quarter Moon.Along the terminator,the shadow line between night and day,you might find these two large cratersstaring back at you withan owlish gaze.Alphonsus(left) andArzachelare ancient impact craters onthe north eastern shores of Mare Nubium, the lunar Sea of Clouds.The larger Alphonsus is over 100 kilometers in diameter.A low sun angle highlights the crater'ssharp 1.5 kilometer high centralpeak in bright sunlight and dark shadow.Scouting for potential Apollo moon landing sites, theRanger 9 spacecraftreturned closeup photographs of Alphonsus beforeit crashed in the crater just northeast (left) of its central mountain in 1965.Alpetragius,between Alphonsus and Arzachel,is the small crater with the deeply shadowed floor andoverly large central peak.
