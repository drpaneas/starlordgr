What color is the universe?  More precisely, if theentire sky were smeared out,what color would the final mix be?  This whimsical question came up when trying to determinewhat stars are commonplace in nearby galaxies.The answer,depicted above,is a conditionally perceived shade ofbeige.In computer parlance: #FFF8E7. To determine this, astronomers computationally averagedthe light emitted by one of the larger samples ofgalaxies analyzed: the 200,000galaxies of the2dF survey.  The resultingcosmic spectrum has some emission in all parts of theelectromagnetic spectrum, but a single perceived composite color.  This color has become much less blue over the past 10 billion years,indicating that redder stars are becoming more prevalent.  In a contest to better name the color, notable entriesincluded skyvory, univeige, and the winner:cosmic latte.
