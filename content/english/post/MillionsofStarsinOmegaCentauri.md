Globular star clusterOmega Centauri,also known as NGC 5139, is some 15,000 light-years away.The cluster is packed with about 10 millionstars much older than the Sun within a volume about 150 light-years indiameter.It's the largest and brightest of 200 or so knownglobularclusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy.Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age andcomposition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence ofdifferentstellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances.In fact,Omega Cen may bethe remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way.Omega Centauri's red giant stars (with ayellowish hue) are easy to pickout in thissharp, color telescopic view.
