These three panels feature the Solar System's rulinggas giant Jupiteron August 15 as seen from Cebu City, Phillipines, planet Earth.On that date thewell-timed telescopic viewsdetail some remarkable performances,transits and mutual events, by Jupiter's Galilean moons.In the top panel,Iois just disappearing into Jupiter's shadow atthe far right, but the three other large Jovian moons appear against theplanet's banded disk.BrighterEuropaand darkerGanymedeare at the far left, also castingtheir two shadows on the gas giant's cloud tops.Callistois below and right near the planet's edge, the three moons ina triple transit across the face of Jupiter.Moving to the middle panel, shadowsof Europa and Ganymede are still visible near centerbut Ganymede has occulted or passed in front of Europa.The bottom panel captures a rare view of Jovian moons in eclipsewhile transiting Jupiter, Ganymede's shadow falling on Europa itself.From planet Earth's perspective, similar mutual events,when Galilean moons occult and eclipse each other,can be seen every six years or so whenJupiter is near its own equinox.
