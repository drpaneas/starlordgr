In the mid 19th century, one of the first photographic technologies usedto record the lunar surface was thewet-plate collodionprocess, notably employed by British astronomerWarren De la Rue.To capture an image, a thick, transparent mixture wasused to coat a glass plate, sensitized with silvernitrate, exposed at the telescope, and then developedto create a negative image on the plate.To maintain photographic sensitivity,the entire process, from coating to exposure to developing, had to becompleted before the plate dried, in a span of about 10 to 15 minutes.This modern version of a wet-plate collodionimage celebrateslunar photography's early days, reproducingthe process using modernchemicals to coat a glass plate from a21st centuryhardware store.Captured last November 28 with an 8x10 view camera and backyard telescope,it faithfully records large craters, bright rays,and dark, smooth mare of thewaxing gibbous Moon.Subsequently digitized, the image on the plate was 8.5 centimeters indiameter and exposed while tracking for 2 minutes.The wet plate's effective photographic sensitivity was about ISO 1. In your smart phone, the camera sensor probably has a photographicsensitivity range of ISO 100 to 6400 (andneeds to bekept dry ...).
