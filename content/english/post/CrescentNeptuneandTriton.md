Gliding silently through the outerSolar System, theVoyager 2 spacecraft camera capturedNeptune andTriton together in crescent phase.  The elegant picture of thegas giant planet and itscloudy moon was taken from behind just afterclosest approach in 1989.  It could not have been taken fromEarth becauseNeptune never shows a crescent phase to sunward Earth.Theunusual vantage point also robsNeptune of its familiar blue hue,as sunlight seen from here is scattered forward,and so is reddened like thesetting Sun.  Neptune is smaller but more massive thanUranus, has severaldark rings, and emits more light than it receives from the Sun.
