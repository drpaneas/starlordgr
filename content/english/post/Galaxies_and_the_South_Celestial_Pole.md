The South Celestial Poleis easy to spot in star trail images of the southern sky.The extension of Earth's axis of rotation to the south, it'sat the center of all the southern star trail arcs.In this starry panoramastreching about 60 degrees across deep southern skiesthe South Celestial Pole is somewhere near the middle though,flanked by bright galaxies and southern celestial gems.Across the top of the frame are the stars and nebulae along the planeof our own Milky Way Galaxy.Gamma Crucis, a yellowish giant starheads the Southern Cross near topcenter, with the dark expanse of the Coalsack nebula tucked under thecross arm on the left.Eta Carinae and the reddish glow of the Great Carina Nebula shine alongthe galactic plane near the right edge.At the bottom are the Large and Small Magellanic clouds,external galaxiesin their own right and satellites of the mighty Milky Way.A line from Gamma Crucis through the blue star at the bottom of thesouthern cross, Alpha Crucis, points toward the South Celestial Pole,but where exactly is it?Just lookfor south pole starSigma Octantis.Analog to Polaris the north pole star,Sigma Octantis is little over one degree fom thethe South Celestial pole.
