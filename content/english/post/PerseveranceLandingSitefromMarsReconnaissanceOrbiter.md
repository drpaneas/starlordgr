Seen from orbit a day after adramatic arrivalon the martian surface, the Perseverance landing siteis identified in this high-resolution viewfrom the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.The orbiter's camera image also reveals the locationof theMars 2020 missiondescent stage, heat shield, andparachute and back shell that delivered Perseveranceto the surface of Mars. Each annotated inset box spans 200 meters (650 feet) across the floor ofJezero Crater.Perseverance islocated at the center of the patterncreated by rocket exhaust as the descent stage hovered andlowered the rover to the surface.Following the sky crane maneuver, thedescent stageitself flew away to crash at a safe distancefrom the rover, its final resting placeindicated by a dark V-shaped debris pattern.Falling to the surface nearby after their separation in the landingsequence,heat shield,parachute and back shelllocations are marked in the high-resolution imagefrom Mars orbit.
