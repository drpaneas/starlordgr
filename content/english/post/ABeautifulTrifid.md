The beautiful Trifid Nebulais a cosmicstudy in contrasts.Also known as M20, it lies about5,000light-years away toward the nebula richconstellation Sagittarius.A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy,the Trifid does illustrate three different types ofastronomical nebulae;red emission nebulae dominated bylight from hydrogen atoms,blue reflection nebulae producedby dust reflecting starlight, anddark nebulae wheredense dust clouds appear in silhouette.But the red emission region roughly separated into threeparts by obscuring dust lanes is what lends the Trifid itspopular name.Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, below and left ofthe emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescopeclose-upimages of the region.The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across.Just too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers thearea of a full moon in planet Earth's sky.
