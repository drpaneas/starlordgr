NGC 6888, also known as the Crescent Nebula, is aabout 25 light-years acrossblown by windsfrom its central, bright, massive star.A triumvirate of astroimagers( Joe,Glenn,Russell)created this sharp portraitof the cosmic bubble.Their telescopic collaborationcollected over 30 hours of narrow band image data isolating light from hydrogenand oxygen atoms.The oxygen atoms produce the blue-green hue that seems to enshroudthe detailed folds and filaments.Visible within the nebula, NGC 6888's central star is classified as aWolf-Rayet star (WR 136).The star is shedding its outer envelope in a strongstellar wind,ejecting the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 10,000 years. The nebula's complex structures are likely the result of thisstrong wind interacting with material ejected in an earlier phase.Burning fuel at a prodigious rate andnear the endof its stellar life this star should ultimately go outwith a bang in a spectacularsupernovaexplosion.Found in the nebula rich constellation Cygnus,NGC 6888 is about 5,000 light-years away.
