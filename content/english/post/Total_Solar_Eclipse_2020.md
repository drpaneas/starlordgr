Along a narrow pathcrossing southern South America through Chileand Argentina, the final New Moon of 2020moved in front of the Sun on December 14 in the year's onlytotal solar eclipse.Within about 2 days of perigee, the closest point in its ellipticalorbit, the New Moon's surface is faintlylit by earthshinein this dramatic composite view.The image is a processed compositeof 55 calibrated exposures ranging from 1/640 to 3 seconds.Covering a large range in brightness during totality,it reveals the dim lunar surface and faint background stars,along withplanet-sizedprominences at the Sun's edge, an enormouscoronal mass ejection,and sweeping coronal structures normally hidden in the Sun's glare.Look closelyfor an ill-fated sungrazing Kreutz family comet(C/2020 X3 SOHO)approaching from the lower left, at about the 7 o'clock position.In 2021 eclipse chasers will see an annular solar eclipse coming upon June 10.They'll have to wait until December 4 for the only totalsolar eclipse in 2021 though.That eclipse will betotal along a narrow path crossing the southernmostcontinent of Antarctica.
