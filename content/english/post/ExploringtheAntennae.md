Some 60 million light-years away in the southerlyconstellationCorvus, two large galaxies are colliding.Stars in the two galaxies, cataloged asNGC 4038 and NGC 4039,very rarely collide in the course of theponderous cataclysm that lasts for hundreds of millions of years.But the galaxies' largeclouds of molecular gas and dustoften do, triggeringfurious episodes of star formationinear the center of thecosmic wreckage.Spanning over 500 thousand light-years, thisstunning view also reveals new star clusters andmatter flung far from the scene of the accident bygravitational tidalforces.Theremarkably sharp ground-based imageincludes narrowbanddata that highlights the characteristic red glow of atomic hydrogengas in star-forming regions.The suggestive overall visual appearance of theextended arcingstructures gives the galaxy pair its popular name - The Antennae.
