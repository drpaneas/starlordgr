The Mars Ingenuity Helicopter,all four landing legs down,was captured here on sol 39 (March 30) slung beneath the belly ofthe Perseverance rover.The near ground level view is a mosaic of imagesfrom the WATSON camera on the rover's SHERLOC robotic arm.Near the center of the frame the experimental helicopteris suspended just a few centimeters above the martian surface.Tracks from Perseverance extend beyond the rover's wheels with the rimof Jezero crater visible about 2 kilometers in the distance.Ingenuity has aweight of 1.8 kilograms or 4 pounds on Earth.That corresponds to aweightof 0.68 kilograms or 1.5 poundson Mars.With rotor blades spanning 1.2 meters it will attempt to make thefirst powered flight of an aircrafton another planetin the thin martian atmosphere, 1 percent as dense as Earth's,no earlier than sol 48 (April 8).
