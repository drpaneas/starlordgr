Eclipses tend to come in pairs.Twice a year, during an eclipse season that lastsabout 34 days,Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align.Then the full and newphases of the Moonseparated by just over 14 days create a lunar and a solar eclipse.Often partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season.But sometimes the alignment at both new moon and full moonphases during a single eclipse season is close enoughto produce a pair of both total (or a total and an annular)lunar and solar eclipses.For this eclipse season,the New Moon followingthe Full Moon'stotal lunar eclipse on May 26did produce an annular solar eclipse along its northerly shadow track.That eclipse is seen here in a partially eclipsed sunrise on June 10,photographed from a fishing pier in Stratford, Connecticutin the northeastern US.
