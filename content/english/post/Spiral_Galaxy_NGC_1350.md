This gorgeous island universe lies about 85 million light-yearsdistant in the southernconstellationFornax.Inhabited by young blue star clusters, thetightly woundspiral arms of NGC 1350seem to join in a circle around the galaxy's large,bright nucleus, giving it the appearance of acosmic eye.In fact, NGC 1350 is about 130,000 light-years across.That makes it as large or slightly larger than the Milky Way.Forearth-based astronomers,NGC 1350 is seen on the outskirts of theFornax clusterof galaxies, but its estimated distance suggests thatit is not itself a cluster member.Of course, the bright spiky stars in the foreground of thistelescopic field of view are members of our own spiralMilky Way galaxy.
