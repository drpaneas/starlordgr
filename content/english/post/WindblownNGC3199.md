NGC 3199 lies about 12,000 light-years away,a glowing cosmic cloud in the nautical southern constellationof Carina.The nebula is about 75 light-years across in thisnarrowband, false-color view.  Though the deep image reveals a more or less completebubble shape, it does look very lopsided with a much brighter edgealong the top.Near the center is aWolf-Rayet star,a massive, hot, short-lived star that generates an intense stellar wind.In fact, Wolf-Rayet stars are known to create nebulaewith interesting shapesas their powerful winds sweep up surroundinginterstellarmaterial.In this case, the bright edge was thought to indicate abow shockproduced as the star plowed through a uniform medium, like a boatthrough water.Butmeasurementshave shown the star is not really moving directlytoward the bright edge.So a more likely explanation is that thematerial surrounding the star is not uniform, butclumped and denser near the bright edge of windblown NGC 3199.
