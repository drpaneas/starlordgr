Why does this galaxy have such a long tail? In this stunning vista, based on image data from the Hubble Legacy Archive,distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop for disrupted spiralgalaxy Arp 188, the Tadpole Galaxy.The cosmic tadpole is a mere 420 million light-years distant toward thenorthern constellation of the Dragon (Draco).Its eye-catching tail is about 280 thousand light-years long and features massive, bright blue star clusters.One story goesthat a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of Arp 188 - from right to left in this view - and wasslung around behind the Tadpole by their gravitational attraction.During theclose encounter, tidal forces drew out thespiral galaxy's stars, gas, and dustforming the spectacular tail.The intruder galaxy itself, estimated tolie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole,can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right.Followingits terrestrial namesake, the Tadpole Galaxy will likely loseits tail as it grows older, the tail's star clustersforming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.
