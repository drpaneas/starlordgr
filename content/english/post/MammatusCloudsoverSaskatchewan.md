When do cloud bottoms appear like bubbles?Normally, cloud bottoms are flat.This is because moist warm airthat rises and cools will condense into water droplets at a specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  As waterdroplets grow, an opaque cloud forms.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a thunderstorm. Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  The mammatus clouds pictured here, lasting only a few minutes, were photographed over Regina,Saskatchewan, Canada,just after a storm in 2012.
