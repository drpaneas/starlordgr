Want to see a ring around the Sun?It's easy to doin daytime skies around the world.Created by randomly oriented ice crystals in thin high cirrus clouds,circular 22 degree halos are visible much more often than rainbows.This one wascaptured by smart phonephotographyon May 29 near Rome, Italy.Carefullyblocking the Sun,for example with a finger tip,is usually all that it takes to revealthe common bright halo ring.The halo's characteristic angular radius is about equalto the span of your hand, thumb to little finger,at the end of your outstretched arm. Want to see aring of fire eclipse?That's harder.The spectacular annular phase oftoday's (June 10) solar eclipse,known as aring of fire,is briefly visible only if you're standing alongthe Moon's narrow shadow track that passes over parts ofnorthern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and eastern Russia.The solar eclipse is partial though, when seenfrom broader regions,including northern Asia, Europe, and parts of the US.
