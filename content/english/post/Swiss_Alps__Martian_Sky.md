Taken on February 6,this snowy mountain and skyscape was capturednear Melchsee-Frutt, central Switzerland, planet Earth.The reddish daylight and blue tinted glow around the afternoon Sun arecolors of the Martian sky, though.Of course both worlds have the same Sun.From Mars, the Sun looks only about half as bright and 2/3 the sizecompared to its appearance from Earth.Lofted from the surface of Mars, fine dust particles suspendedin the thin Martian atmosphere are rich in the iron oxides that makethe Red Planet red.They tend to absorb blue sunlight giving a red tinge to theMartian sky,while forward scattering still makes the lightappear relatively bluish near the smaller, fainter Martian Sun.Normally Earth's denser atmosphere strongly scatters blue light, makingthe terrestrial sky blue.But on February 6 ahuge cloud of dustblown across the Mediterraneanfrom the Sahara desert reached the Swiss Alps, dimming the Sun andlending that Alpine afternoon the colors of the Martian sky.By the next day, only the snow was left covered with reddish dust.
