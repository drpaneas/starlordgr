These three bright nebulae are often featured on telescopic tours of theconstellation Sagittarius and the crowded starfields ofthe central Milky Way.In fact, 18th century cosmic touristCharles Messiercataloged two of them; M8,the large nebula below and right of center,and colorful M20near the top of the frame.The third emission region includesNGC 6559, left of M8 andseparated from the larger nebula by a dark dust lane.All three are stellar nurseries aboutfive thousand light-years or so distant.Over a hundred light-years across the expansive M8is also known as the Lagoon Nebula.M20's popular moniker is the Trifid.Glowing hydrogen gas creates the dominant red color of theemission nebulae.But for striking contrast, blue hues in theTrifid are due to dust reflected starlight.Thebroad interstellarscapespans almost 4 degrees or 8 full moons on the sky.
