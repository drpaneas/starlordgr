Have you ever watched the Moon rise?The slow rise of a nearly full moon over a clear horizon can be an impressive sight.One impressive moonrise was imaged in early 2013 over Mount VictoriaLookout in Wellington, New Zealand.With detailed planning, an industrious astrophotographer placed a camera about two kilometers away and pointed it across the lookout to where the Moon would surely soon be making its nightly debut.The featured single shot sequence is unedited and shown in real time -- it is not a time lapse.People on Mount Victoria Lookout can be seen in silhouette themselves admiring the dawn of Earth's largest satellite.Seeing a moonrise yourself is not difficult: it happens every day, although only half the time at night.Each day the Moon rises about fifty minutes later than the previous day, with a full moon always rising at sunset.
