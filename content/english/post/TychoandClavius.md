South is upin this detailed telescopic view across the Moon's ruggedsouthern highlands.Captured on July 20, the lunar landscape features the Moon's young and old,the large craters Tycho and Clavius.About 100 million years young,Tycho isthe sharp-walled 85 kilometerdiameter crater near center, its 2 kilometer tall central peakin bright sunlight anddark shadow.Debris ejected during the impact that created Tycho still make it thestandout lunar crater when theMoon is near full, producinga highly visible radiating system of light streaks,bright rays that extend across much of the lunar near side.In fact, some of the material collected at the Apollo 17 landing site,about 2,000 kilometers away, likely originatedfrom the Tycho impact. One of the oldest and largest craters on the Moon's near side,225 kilometer diameterClavius is due south(above) of Tycho.Clavius crater'sown ray system resulting from its original impact eventwould have faded long ago.The old crater's worn walls and smooth floor are now overlayed bysmaller craters from impacts that occurred after Clavius wasformed.Observations by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy(SOFIA) published in 2020 foundwater at Clavius.Of course both young Tycho and old Clavius cratersare lunar locations in the science fiction epic2001: A Space Odyssey.
