Light-years across, thissuggestive shape known as the Seahorse Nebulaappears in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars.Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus,the dusty, obscuring clouds are part of a Milky Waymolecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant.It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182dark markings of the skycataloged in the early 20th centuryby astronomer E. E. Barnard.Packs of low mass stars are formingwithin,but their collapsing cores are only visible at longinfrared wavelengths.Still, the colorful stars of Cepheus add to thispretty, galacticskyscape.
