It is one of the more massive galaxies known.A mere 46 million light-years distant, spiral galaxy NGC 2841can be found in the northern constellation ofUrsa Major.This sharp view of the gorgeousisland universeshows off a striking yellow nucleus and galactic disk.Dust lanes, small, pink star-forming regions, and young blue star clustersare embedded in the patchy, tightlywoundspiral arms.In contrast, many other spiralsexhibit grand, sweeping arms with large star-forming regions. NGC 2841 has a diameter of over 150,000 light-years, even larger thanour ownMilky Way.The featured composite image merges exposures from the orbiting 2.4-meter Hubble Space Telescope and the ground-based 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope.  X-ray imagessuggest that resulting winds and stellar explosions createplumes of hot gas extending into a halo around NGC 2841.
