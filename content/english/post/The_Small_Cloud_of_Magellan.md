What is the Small Magellanic Cloud?It has turned out to be a galaxy. People who have wondered about this little fuzzy patch in the southern sky included Portuguese navigatorFerdinand Magellan and his crew, who had plentyof time to study the unfamiliar night sky of the south during thefirst circumnavigation of planet Earth in the early 1500s.As a result, two celestial wonders easily visible for southern hemisphere skygazers are now known in Western culture as the Clouds of Magellan.Within the past 100 years, research has shown that these cosmic clouds are dwarf irregular galaxies,satellites of our larger spiral Milky Way Galaxy.The Small Magellanic Cloudactually spans 15,000 light-years or soand contains several hundred million stars.About 210,000 light-years away in the constellation of the Tucan (Tucana),it is more distant than other known Milky Way satellite galaxies, including theSagittarius Dwarf galaxy and theLarge Magellanic Cloud.Thissharp image also includes the foreground globularstar cluster 47 Tucanae on the right.
