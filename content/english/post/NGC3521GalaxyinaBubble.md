Gorgeous spiral galaxy NGC 3521 is a mere 35 million light-years away,toward theconstellation Leo.Relatively bright in planet Earth's sky, NGC 3521 iseasily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked byamateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies,like M66 and M65.It's hard to overlook inthis colorful cosmic portrait, though.Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sportscharacteristicpatchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star formingregions, and clusters of young, blue stars.Remarkably, this deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded ingigantic bubble-like shells.The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars tornfrom satellite galaxies that haveundergone mergerswith NGC 3521 in the distant past.
