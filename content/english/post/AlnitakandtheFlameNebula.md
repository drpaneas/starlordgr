What lights up the Flame Nebula?  Fifteen hundredlight years away towards the constellation of Orion lies a nebula which, from its glow and darkdust lanes,appears, on the left, like a billowing fire.  But fire,the rapid acquisition ofoxygen,is not what makes thisFlame glow.  Rather the bright star Alnitak, the easternmost star in theBelt of Orionvisible on the far left, shines energetic light into theFlame that knocks electrons away from the great clouds of hydrogengas that reside there.  Much of the glow results when the electrons andionized hydrogen recombine. The featured picture of the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) was taken across three visible color bands with detail added by a long duration exposure taken in light emitted only by hydrogen. The Flame Nebula is part of theOrion Molecular Cloud Complex,a star-forming region that includes the famousHorsehead Nebula.
