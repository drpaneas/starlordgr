If not perfect then thisspiralgalaxy is at least one of the most photogenic.An island universe of about 100 billion stars,32 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces,M74 presentsa gorgeous face-on view.Classified asan Sc galaxy,the grand design of M74's graceful spiralarms are traced by bright bluestar clusters and dark cosmic dustlanes.This sharp compositewas constructed from image data recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope'sAdvanced Camera for Surveys.Spanning about 30,000 light-years across theface of M74, it includes exposures recording emission fromhydrogen atoms, highlighting the reddish glow of thegalaxy's large star-forming regions.With a lower surface brightness than most galaxies in theMessier catalog,M74 is sometimes known as thePhantom Galaxy.
