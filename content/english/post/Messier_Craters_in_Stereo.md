Many bright nebulae and star clusters in planet Earth's skyare associated with the name ofastronomer Charles Messierfrom his famous 18th century catalog.His name is also given to these two large and remarkable craterson the Moon.Standouts in the dark,smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or MareFecunditatis, Messier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8and 16 by 11 kilometers respectively.Their elongated shapes are explained by theextremely shallow-angle trajectory followed byan impactor, moving left to right, that gouged out the craters.The shallow impact also resulted in twobright rays of materialextending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture.Intended to be viewed withred/blue glasses (red for the left eye),this striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently createdfrom high resolution scans of two images(AS11-42-6304,AS11-42-6305)taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon.
