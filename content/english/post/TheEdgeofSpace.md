Where does space begin?For purposes of spaceflight some would say at theKarman line,currently defined as an altitude of 100 kilometers (60 miles).Others might place a line 80 kilometers (50 miles) above Earth's mean sea level.But there is no sharp physicalboundary that marks the end ofatmosphere and the beginning of space.In fact, the Karman line itself is near the transition between theupper mesophere and lower thermosphere.Night shining or noctilucent cloudsare high-latitude summer apparitionsformed at altitudes near the top of the mesophere,up to 80 kilometers or so, also known as polar mesopheric clouds.Auroral bandsof the northern (and southern) lights caused byenergetic particles exciting atoms in the thermosphere canextend above 80 kilometers to over 600 kilometers altitude.Taken from a cockpit while flying at an altitude of 10 kilometers(33,000 feet) in the realm ofstratospheric aeronautics,this snapshot captures bothnoctilucent clouds and aurora borealis under a starry sky,looking toward planet Earth's horizonand the edge of space.
