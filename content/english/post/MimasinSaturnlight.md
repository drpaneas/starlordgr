Peering from the shadows, theSaturn-facing hemisphere of Mimas lies in near darkness alongside adramatic sunlit crescent.The mosaic was captured near the Cassinispacecraft's finalclose approach on January 30, 2017.Cassini's camera was pointed in anearly sunward direction only 45,000 kilometers from Mimas.The result is one of the highest resolution views of the icy, crater-pocked,400kilometer diameter moon.An enhanced version better reveals the Saturn-facing hemisphere ofthe synchronously rotating moon lit by sunlight reflected fromSaturn itself.To see it, slide your cursor over the image (orfollow this link).Other Cassini images of Mimas include the small moon's large and ominousHerschel Crater.
