How far can you see?TheAndromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light years away, is the most distantobject easily seen by the unaided eye.Other denizens of the night sky, like stars, clusters, and nebulae,are typically hundreds to thousands of light-years distant.That's far beyond the Solar System but well withinour own Milky Way Galaxy.Also known as M31, the external galaxy posesdirectly above a chimney in this well-planneddeep night skyscapefrom an old mine in southern Portugal.The image was captured in a single exposure tracking the sky,so the foreground is slightly blurred by the camera's motion whileAndromeda itself looms large.The galaxy's brighter central region, normally all that'svisible to the naked-eye, can be seen extending to spiral armswith fainter outer reaches spanning over 4 full moons across the sky.Of course in only 5 billion years or so, the stars of Andromeda couldspan theentire night sky as the Andromeda Galaxymerges with the Milky Way.
