This pretty field of view spans over 2 degreesor 4 full moons on the sky,filled with stars toward the constellation Taurus, the Bull.Above and right of center in the frame you can spot the faint fuzzy reddishappearance of Messier 1 (M1),also known as the Crab Nebula.M1 is the first object in 18th century comet hunterCharles Messier's famous catalog of things which aredefinitely not comets.Made from image data captured this October 11,there is a comet in the picture though.Below center and left lies the faint greenish coma and dustytail of periodic comet67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko,also known as Rosetta's comet.In the 21st century, it became thefinal resting place ofrobots from planet Earth.Rosetta's comet isnow returning to the inner solar system, sweepingtoward its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun, on November 2.Too faint to be seenby eye alone, the comet's next perigee or closestapproach to Earth will be November 12.
