Awash in a sea ofincandescent plasmaand anchored in strongmagnetic fields,sunspots are planet-sized dark islands inthe solar photosphere,the bright surface of the Sun.Found in solar active regions, sunspots lookdarkonly because they are slightly cooler though,with temperatures of about 4,000kelvinscompared to 6,000 kelvins for the surrounding solar surface.These sunspots lie in active region AR2835.The largest active regionnow crossing the Sun,AR2835 is captured in this sharp telescopic close-up from July 1in a field of view that spans about 150,000 kilometersor over ten Earth diameters.With powerful magnetic fields,solar active regionsare often responsible for solar flares and coronal mass ejections, storms which affectspace weathernearplanet Earth.
