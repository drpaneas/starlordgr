A bright spiral galaxy of the northern sky,Messier 63is nearby,about 30 million light-years distant toward the loyal constellationCanes Venatici.Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majesticisland universeis nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the sizeof our own Milky Way.Its bright coreand majesticspiral arms lend the galaxyits popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy,while this exceptionally deep exposure also followsfaint, arcing star streams far into the galaxy'shalo.Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic centerthe star streams are likely remnants oftidally disruptedsatellites of M63.Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in thisremarkable wide-field image,made with a small telescope, including fivenewlyidentifiedfaint dwarf galaxies,which could contribute to M63's star streams in the next few billionyears.
