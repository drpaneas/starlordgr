Clouds of glowing hydrogen gas fill this colorful skyscape in the faintbut fanciful constellationMonoceros,the Unicorn.A star forming regioncatalogedas NGC 2264, the complex jumble ofcosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light-years distant andmixes reddish emission nebulaeexcited by energetic light fromnewborn stars with darkinterstellar dust clouds.Where the otherwise obscuring dust clouds lie closeto the hot, young stars they also reflect starlight, forming bluereflection nebulae.Thetelescopic imagespans about 1.5 degrees or 3 full moons,covering nearly 80 light-years at the distance of NGC 2264.Its cast of cosmic characters includes thethe Fox Fur Nebula, whosedusty, convoluted pelt lies left of center,bright variable star S Monocerotis immersed in the blue-tinted hazenear center, and theConeNebula pointing in from the right side of the frame.Of course, the starsof NGC 2264are also known as the Christmas Tree star cluster.The triangular tree shape is seen on its side here.Traced by brighter stars it has its apex at the Cone Nebula.The tree's broader base is centered nearSMonocerotis.
