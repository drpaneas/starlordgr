Shaped like a cone tapering into space, the Earth's darkcentral shadow or umbrahas a circular cross-section.It's wider than the Moon at the distance ofthe Moon's orbit though.Butduring the lunar eclipseof November 18/19, part ofthe Moon remained just outside the umbral shadow.The successive picturesin this composite of 5 images from thatalmost total lunar eclipsewere taken over a period of about 1.5 hours.The series is aligned to trace part of the cross-section'scirculararc, with the central image at maximum eclipse.It shows a bright, thin sliver of the lunar disk still beyondthe shadow's curved edge.Of course, even within the shadow the Moon's surface is not completelydark, reflecting the reddish hues of filtered sunlight scatteredinto the shadow by Earth's atmosphere.
