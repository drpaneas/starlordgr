Farther back on the right side of the frame the a dark angularboulder spans about 1.5 meters (5 feet).Also in view are two trenches dug by the lander's sampler arm,the ejected protective shroud that covered the soil collector head,and one of the lander's dust covered footpads at the lower right.On May 14,China’s Zhurong Marsrover successfully touchdown on Mars and has returned the first images of`itslanding site in Utopia Planitia.
