Stars fill this infrared view, spanning 4 light-years across the centerof the Lagoon Nebula.Visible light imagesshow the glowing gas and obscuring dust clouds thatdominate the scene.But this infrared image,constructed fromHubble Space Telescope data,peers closer to the heart of the active star-forming region revealingnewborn stars scattered within,against a crowded field of background starstoward the center of our Milky Way galaxy.This tumultuous stellar nursery'scentral regions are sculpted andenergized by the massive, young Herschel 36, seen as the bright starnear center in the field of view.Herschel 36is actually a multiple system of massive stars.At over 30 times the mass of the Sun and less than 1 million years old,the most massive star in the systemshould live to a stellar old age of 5 million years.Compare that to the almost 5billionyear old Sun which will evolve into a red giantin only another 5 billion years or so.The Lagoon Nebula,also known as M8, lies about 4,000 light-yearsaway within the boundaries of the constellation Sagittarius.
