Except for the ringsof Saturn, the RingNebula (M57) is probably the most famous celestial circle.Its classic appearance isunderstood to be due to our own perspective, though.The recent mapping of theexpanding nebula's3-D structure, based in part onthis clear Hubble image,indicates thatthe nebula is a relatively dense, donut-like ring wrappedaround the middle of a (American) football-shaped cloud of glowing gas.The view from planet Earth looks down the long axis of the football,face-on to the ring.Of course, in this well-studied example of aplanetary nebula, the glowing materialdoes not come from planets.Instead, the gaseous shroud represents outer layers expelledfrom the dying,oncesun-like star, now a tiny pinprick of lightseen at the nebula's center.Intense ultraviolet light from the hot central starionizes atoms in the gas.The Ring Nebula is about one light-yearacross and 2,500 light-years away.
