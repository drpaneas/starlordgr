Get out your red-blue glasses andhover over the surface of Mars.Taken on July 24, the 3D color view is from the MarsIngenuity Helicopter's 10thflight above the Red Planet.Two images from Ingenuity's color camera,both captured at an altitude of 12 meters (40 feet), but a few meters apartto provide a stereo perspective, were used to construct the color anaglyph.Ingenuity's stereo images were made at the request of the MarsPerseverancerover science team.The team is considering a visitto these raised ridges on the floor of Jezero Crater during Perseverance'sfirst science campaign.
