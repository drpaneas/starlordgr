Comet Leonard, brightest comet of 2021,is at the lower left of these two panelscaptured on December 29 in dark Atacama desert skies.Heading for its perihelion on January 3Comet Leonard's visible tailhas grown.Stacked exposures with a wide angle lens(also displayed in a reversed B/W scheme for contrast),trace the complicated ion tail for an amazing 60 degrees, withbright Jupiter shining near the horizon at lower right.Material vaporizingfrom Comet Leonard's nucleus,a mass of dust, rock, and ices about 1 kilometer across,has produced the long tail of ionized gas fluorescing in the sunlight.Likely flares on thecomet's nucleusand buffeting by magnetic fields and the solar wind in recent weekshave resulted in the tail's irregularpinched and twisted appearance.Still days from its closest approach to the Sun,Comet Leonard's activityshould continue.The comet issouth of the Solar System'secliptic plane as it sweeps through the southern constellation Microscopium.
