One of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky is similar in sizeto our Milky Way Galaxy: big,beautifulMessier 81.Also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's galaxy for its 18th century discoverer,this grand spiralcan be found toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.The sharp,detailed telescopic view reveals M81's bright yellow nucleus, bluespiral arms, pinkish starforming regions, and sweepingcosmic dust lanes.Some dust lanes actually run through the galactic disk (left of center),contrary to other prominentspiral features though.The errant dust lanes may be the lingeringresult of a close encounter betweenM81 and the nearby galaxy M82 lurking outside of this frame.M81's faint, dwarf irregular satellite galaxy, Holmberg IX,can be seen just below the large spiral.Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 has yielded awell-determined distancefor an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years.
