It's easy to get lost following the intricate looping filaments inthis detailed image ofsupernova remnant Simeis 147.Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240 it goes by the popular nickname,the Spaghetti Nebula.Seen towardthe boundary of the constellations Taurus and Auriga,it covers nearly 3 degrees or 6 full moons on the sky.That's about 150 light-years atthe stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years.This composite includes image data taken through narrow-band filterswhere reddish emission from ionized hydrogen atoms and doubly ionizedoxygen atoms in faint blue-green hues trace the shocked, glowing gas.The supernova remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000years, meaning light from the massive stellar explosion firstreached Earth 40,000 years ago.But the expanding remnant is not the only aftermath.The cosmic catastrophealso left behinda spinning neutron star or pulsar,all that remains of the original star's core.
