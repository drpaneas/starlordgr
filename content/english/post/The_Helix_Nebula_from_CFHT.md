Will our Sun look like this one day?  The Helix Nebula is one of brightest and closest examples of aplanetary nebula, a gascloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star.The outer gasses of the starexpelled into space appear from ourvantage point as if we are looking down a helix.The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light soenergetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce.The Helix Nebula, given a technical designation ofNGC 7293,lies about 700 light-years away towards theconstellation of the Water Bearer (Aquarius)and spans about 2.5 light-years.The featured picture was taken with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii, USA.A close-up of theinner edge of the Helix Nebula shows complex gas knots ofunknown origin.
