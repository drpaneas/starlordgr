In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). This means they’ll have to procure their own sources of water, building materials, and grow their own food. While the ISS has allowed for all kinds of experiments involving hydroponics in space, little has been done to see how soil fares in microgravity (or lower gravity). To address this, Deep Space Ecology (DSE) – a Virginia-based space and agricultural startup – recently sent their Soil Health in Space experiment to the ISS.
