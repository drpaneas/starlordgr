Big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 1055 is a dominant member ofa small galaxy groupa mere 60 million light-years away towardthe aquatically intimidating constellation Cetus.Seen edge-on, the island universe spans over 100,000 light-years,a little larger than ourown Milky Way galaxy.The colorful, spiky stars decorating this cosmicportraitof NGC 1055 are in the foreground, well within the Milky Way.But the telltale pinkish star formingregions are scattered throughwinding dust lanes along the distant galaxy's thin disk.With a smattering of even more distant background galaxies, thedeep image also reveals a boxy halo that extendsfar above and below the central bluge and disk of NGC 1055.The halo itself is laced with faint, narrow structures,and could represent the mixed and spread outdebris from a satellite galaxydisrupted bythe larger spiral some10 billion years ago.
