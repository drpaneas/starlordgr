Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in asupernova leaving theVeil Nebula.At the time, the expanding cloudwas likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remainingvisible for weeks to people living at the dawn ofrecorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and isnow visible only through a small telescopedirectedtoward theconstellation of the Swan(Cygnus).The remaining VeilNebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of thefull Moon.  The featured picture is a Hubble Space Telescope mosaic of six images together covering a span of only about two light years, a small part of the expansive supernova remnant.In images of thecomplete Veil Nebula, evenstudious readers might not be able to identify the featured filaments.
