Normally faint and elusive, the Jellyfish Nebula is caught inthis alluring scene.In the telescopic field of view two bright yellowish stars,Mu andEtaGeminorum, stand just below and above the Jellyfish Nebula at the left.Cool red giants, they lie at the foot of thecelestialtwin.The Jellyfish Nebula itself floats below and left of center, a bright arcingridge of emission with dangling tentacles.In fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shapedsupernova remnant IC 443, the expandingdebris cloud from amassive star that exploded.Light from that explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years ago.Like its cousin inastrophysical waters theCrab Nebula supernova remnant,the Jellyfish Nebula isknownto harbor a neutron star, the remnant of the collapsed stellar core.Composed on April 30, this telescopic snapshot also captures Mars.Now wanderingthrough early evening skies,the Red Planet also shines with a yellowish glow on theright hand side of the field of view.Of course, the Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away, whileMars is currentlyalmost 18 light-minutes from Earth.
