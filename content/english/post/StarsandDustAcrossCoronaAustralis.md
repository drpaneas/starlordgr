Cosmic dust clouds cross a rich field of stars inthis telescopic vista near the northern boundary ofCorona Australis, the Southern Crown.Less than 500 light-years away the dust cloudseffectively block light frommore distant background stars in theMilky Way.Top to bottom the frame spans about 2 degrees or over 15 light-years atthe clouds' estimated distance.At top right is a groupof lovely reflection nebulae cataloged asNGC 6726, 6727, 6729,and IC 4812.A characteristic blue color is produced as lightfrom hot stars is reflected bythe cosmic dust.The dust also obscures from view starsin the regionstill in the process of formation.Just above the bluish reflection nebulae a smaller NGC 6729 surroundsyoung variable starR Coronae Australis.To its right are telltale reddish arcs and loops identified asHerbig Haro objectsassociated with energetic newborn stars.Magnificent globular star cluster NGC 6723is at bottom left in the frame.Though NGC 6723 appearsto be partof the group,its ancient stars actually lie nearly 30,000 light-years away,far beyond the young stars of the Corona Australis dust clouds.
