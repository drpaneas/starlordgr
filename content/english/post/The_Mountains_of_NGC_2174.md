This fantastic skyscapelies near the edgeof NGC 2174 a star formingregion about 6,400 light-years away in the nebula-rich constellationof Orion.It follows mountainous clouds of gas and dust carved bywinds and radiation from the region'snewborn stars, now foundscatteredin open star clusters embedded around the center of NGC 2174,off the top of the frame.Though star formation continues within these dusty cosmic cloudsthey will likely be dispersed by the energetic newbornstars within a few million years.Recorded at infrared wavelengths by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014, theinterstellar scenespans about 6 light-years.Scheduled for launch in 2021, theJames Webb Space Telescopeis optimized for exploring the Universe at infrared wavelengths.
