Found in far southern skies, deep within the boundaries of theconstellation Dorado,NGC 1947 is some 40 million light-years away.In silhouette against starlight, obscuring lanes of cosmic dustthread across the peculiar galaxy's bright central regions.Unlike the rotation of stars, gas, and dust tracing the arms ofspiral galaxies, the motions of dust and gas don't follow the motions of starsin NGC 1947 though.Their more complicateddisconnected motion suggest this galaxy'svisible threads of dust and gasmay have come from a donor galaxy, accreted by NGC 1947 duringthe last 3 billion years or so of the peculiar galaxy's evolution.With spiky foreground Milky Way stars andeven more distant background galaxies scattered through the frame,this sharp Hubble imagespans about 25,000 light-years near the center of NGC 1947.
