From afar, the whole thing looks like an Eagle. A closer look at the Eagle Nebula,however, shows thebrightregion is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust.  Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appearswhere a whole open cluster of stars is being formed.  In this cavity tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gasremain where stars are still forming.  Already visible are several young bright blue stars whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the remaining filaments and walls of gas and dust.  The Eagle emission nebula,tagged M16, lies about 6500light years away, spans about 20 light-years,and is visible withbinoculars towardthe constellation of the Serpent(Serpens).  This picture involved over 12 hours of imaging and combines three specific emitted colors emitted by sulfur (colored as red), hydrogen (yellow), and oxygen (blue).
