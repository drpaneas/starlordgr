Would theRosette Nebula by any othername look as sweet?The bland New General Catalogdesignation of NGC 2237 doesn't appear to diminish the appearance of this flowery emission nebula, at the top of the image, atop a long stem of glowing hydrogen gas.Inside the nebula lies anopen clusterof bright young stars designatedNGC 2244.These starsformed about four million years ago from the nebularmaterial and theirstellar winds are clearing a hole in the nebula's center,insulated by a layer of dust and hot gas.Ultraviolet light from thehot cluster stars causes the surrounding nebula toglow.The Rosette Nebula spans about 100light-years across, liesabout 5000 light-years away,and can be seen with a small telescope towards the constellation ofthe Unicorn (Monoceros).
